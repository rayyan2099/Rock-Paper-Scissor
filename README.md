🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure.

CSS3 / Bulma: Responsive layout and UI components.

Score Tracking: Real-time score updates for both the Player and the "Machine GOD" (CPU).

Custom Game Length: Users can select the winning threshold (3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 points) using a dynamic dropdown.

Dynamic UI: Utilizes Bulma’s CSS classes to provide visual feedback (Success/Danger colors) based on the game outcome.

State Management: Implemented logic to disable game buttons once a winner is declared, preventing post-game interactions.

Responsive Design: Fully mobile-friendly layout that adapts to various screen sizes using Bulma’s grid system.
